// here we are creating an instance of our lottery contract that js can interact with.
// we need to import our instance of web3 (module) which was already prepared in the web3.js file
// to interact with an already deployed contract we need its abi and address.
// i was forced to use abi as a variable name instead of interface. which is what we used in the earlier projects. just a note to u that they refer to the same thing
